&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><strong>Malcolm Liepke</big></strong> was born in 1953 and raised in Minneapolis. 

Liepke's masterful use and knowledge of his chosen medium, is the culmination of a long and ongoing apprenticeship, studying aspects of painters he holds in high esteem. Compositional and tonal nods to the likes of Singer Sargent, Whistler and Degas, the patterns and textures of Vuillard and an ever- evolving palette of vibrant colours, result in a combination, which defines Liepke's unique identity as a contemporary painter.
Loose brushstrokes and dusty gray-green skin tones imbue his subjects with a fleshy sensuality, while simple gestures and expressions convey emotions. Leipke paints from photographs and works in a wet-on-wet technique, borrowed from artists like Sargent and Velázquez, in which layers of oil paint are built up without drying in between.
