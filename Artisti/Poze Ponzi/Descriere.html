&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<big><strong>Emiliano Ponzi</big></strong> is based in Milan, Italy. His bold textured illustrations use repetition, a judicious use of line and strong graphic compositions to define and communicate the concept at hand. The play of visual metaphor and symbolism are continuous themes throughout his work. His illustrations appear in advertising, magazines, books, newspapers and animation, for clients that include The New York Times, Le Monde, The New Yorker, Louis Vuitton, Newsweek, Time Out New York, Hyundai, Esquire, and Amnesty International. Italian clients include Armani, La Repubblica, Feltrinelli, Lavazza, Mondadori, TIM, Rolling Stone, and the Triennale Design Museum. He is considered one of the finest illustrators of his generation.
