&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<big><strong>David Bray</strong></big> is an illustrator/artist based in South London. As an artist David has exhibited in London, Tokyo, New York, Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Portland, Los Angeles and Perth. 
His compelling works come from a lifetime love of drawing and an active imagination. Born in Dartford, Kent, in 1970, as a child Bray would draw images of space travel, where he would depict himself and his friends visiting other planets and universes. His interest soon moved to London in the 1970’s, but too young for the punk movement to interest him, he began to explore a dark, egotistical fantasy world, which is still apparent in the work he makes today.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUsing basic working tools, such as pens, pencils and paper bought from ordinary stationary shops, Bray creates intricate, time-consuming drawings, which explore emotion, utopia and a world of fantasy. Many of the works are based on past experiences, old relationships or current friendships, which is apparent from the titles he gives works . At first glance these works are images of perfection, but the title suggests something lost, or a feeling of regret, and suddenly they become bitter portraits of disappointment and missed chances. This sinister side is apparent in much of Bray's work, which can often be quite dark.
