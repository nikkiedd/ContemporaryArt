&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><strong>Ira Tsantekidou</big></strong> is a Greek painter, who has become well-known for her paintings of women.
She is also famous for her outstanding graphic skills and unique methods of painting.The use of different  materials will make one feel the picture is more of a sculpture than a painting.  
The reaction of light on the canvass often gives the painting a very lifelike quality.

It is amazing how, with the use of earthy, warm metallic and gold colors, the paintings become as romantic as they do interesting, giving an aura of contentment and happiness, therefore making them possible to be displayed in
either an office or a lounge.
