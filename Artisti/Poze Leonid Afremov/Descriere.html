&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><strong>Leonid Afremov</big></strong> is a Russian-Israeli modern impressionistic artist who works mainly with a palette knife and oils. He developed his own unique technique and style which is unmistakable and cannot be confused with other artists. Afremov is mainly known as being a self-representing artist who promotes and sells his work exclusively over the internet with very little exhibitions and involvement of dealers and galleries.
Mr. Afremov proves that elegancy and delicacy of the art aren't really gone. While many other artists try to shock the public with something slangy, this painter respects traditions. He doesn't follow them automatically but takes the best from every style.  Modern wall art can be meaningful and clear to the public – that's the idea of his paintings.
