&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><strong>Vel Miller</big></strong> is an American artist. In painting and sculpting, she concentrates on the more emotional view of the West. Vel says, "The most rugged and strongest people I've known have also been the kindest and most loving. This is the feeling I try to portray. I want the person who views my work to see something they have experienced themselves, or to feel a mood that brings them happiness."
