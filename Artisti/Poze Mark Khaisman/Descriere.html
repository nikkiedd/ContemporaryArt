&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><strong>Mark Khaisman</big></strong> is a Ukrainian-born visual artist who currently lives and works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, having relocated to the United States in 1989. He creates his works by applying layers of translucent packaging tape on clear, backlit Plexiglas panels in order to create areas of light and shadow that, viewed as a whole, compose images of recognizable persons or objects. Khaisman's subject matter has come from various sources, including art history, old movies, 20th century propaganda art, and his own photographs.
