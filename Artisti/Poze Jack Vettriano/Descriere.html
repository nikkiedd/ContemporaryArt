&nbsp;&nbsp;<big><strong>Jack Vettriano</big></strong> is a self taught Scottish painter,who manipulates paint in veiled glazes and meaningful shadows, an image maker whose work is a fascinating part of cultural history. In many of his paintings, there is a hidden narrative, in enigmatic compositions, a starting point for dozens of short stories. Vettriano's style has been compared to that of Hopper's and Sickert's, and his scudded beaches to those of Boudin.
